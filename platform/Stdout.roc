module [line!, Err]

import Effect

## **NotFound** - An entity was not found, often a file.
##
## **PermissionDenied** - The operation lacked the necessary privileges to complete.
##
## **BrokenPipe** - The operation failed because a pipe was closed.
##
## **AlreadyExists** - An entity already exists, often a file.
##
## **Interrupted** - This operation was interrupted. Interrupted operations can typically be retried.
##
## **Unsupported** - This operation is unsupported on this platform. This means that the operation can never succeed.
##
## **OutOfMemory** - An operation could not be completed, because it failed to allocate enough memory.
##
## **Other** - A custom error that does not fall under any other I/O error kind.
